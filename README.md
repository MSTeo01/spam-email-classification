# Spam Email Classification

## What is it?

A Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm I used that would be able to distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails with around 94% accuracy.

This project was originally done in Python through a Jupyter Notebook. Scikit-learn was utilized for machine learning, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for analyzing text data, and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualizations. Due to course policies, I'm unable to publicly post any code. However, I have transcribed relevant information in a LaTeX report above. Code can be seen upon request (with the exception of students at UC Berkeley).
